                <div class="faq-question">What is self-employment tax?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Self-employment tax is the Social Security and Medicare tax that self-employed individuals must pay. As a freelancer, you're responsible for both the employee and employer portions of these taxes, totaling approximately 15.3% of your net income.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Why is my take-home pay different from my gross income?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Your take-home pay is lower than your gross income because of taxes. This includes federal income tax, self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare), and state income tax (if applicable). These are automatically deducted from your earnings.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is the standard deduction?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The standard deduction is a fixed amount that reduces your taxable income. For 2025, the standard deduction for single filers is $14,600. This means you only pay taxes on income above this amount.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How do federal tax brackets work?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    The U.S. uses a progressive tax system with multiple tax brackets. You don't pay the same rate on all your income. Instead, different portions of your income are taxed at different rates. For example, your first $11,000 might be taxed at 10%, the next $44,725 at 12%, and so on.

                <div class="faq-question">Do all states have income tax?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    No. Nine states have no state income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming, and New Hampshire (no tax on wages). If you live in one of these states, you won't owe state income tax on your freelance income.

                <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between 2025 and 2026 tax rules?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Tax brackets, standard deductions, and other tax parameters are adjusted annually for inflation. The 2026 projections in this calculator are estimates based on current trends. Actual 2026 tax rates will be announced by the IRS in late 2025.

                <div class="faq-question">Can I use this for quarterly estimated taxes?</div>

                <div class="faq-question">What if I have multiple income sources?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    If you have multiple income sources (freelance work, W-2 employment, investments, etc.), you should combine all income when calculating your taxes. This calculator is designed for freelance income only. For complex situations, consult a tax professional.
